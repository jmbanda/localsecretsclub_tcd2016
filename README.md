- API in-depth knowledge: We had a great time learning the new APIs and their functionality. We also struggled a bit with some other APIs, but manage to make it work for most.

## What's next for test

Messaging Social Influencers - We live in the era of real-time, social engagement. If you are a travel or hospitality brand, you want to meet your customer right when he is when he is making a decision. Promote brands genuinely through the voice of social influencers from the Local Secrets.Club.

Make better decisions using data, since we will have a human curated resource that is unlike anything else currently available. However, we will continue to test different monetization models based on metrics.
