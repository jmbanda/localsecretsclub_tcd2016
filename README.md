Excellent team collaboration between team, optimizing towards goals,and solving the problem.

- API in-depth knowledge: We had a great time learning the new APIs and their functionality. We also struggled a bit with some other APIs, but manage to make it work for most.

## What's next for test

Make better decisions using data, since we will have a human curated resource that is unlike anything else currently available. However, we will continue to test different monetization models based on metrics.
