## Inspiration

## What it does


LocalSecrets.club brings the community together around common interests. With LocalSecrets.club is simple, personal and fun. 

Every local person has its favourite place he frequently visits: like favourite parks, restaurants, or hikes. What if you can be rewarded for his knowledge by haring it with new city explorers.
